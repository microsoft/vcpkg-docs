# vcpkg in Continuous Integration environments

This article describes how to effectively use vcpkg in a continuous integration
(CI) environment. Either because you are using vcpkg to manage your project's
dependencies or you have a custom vcpkg registry and want to add CI tests for
your ports.

## Acquire vcpkg

The steps to acquire vcpkg in a CI environment are the same as those to acquire
vcpkg in your development environment. You need to acquire a clone of the vcpkg
repository at <https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg> and you need to run the
bootstrap script to get a vcpkg executable.

Regardless of the acquisition method you follow, it is highly recommended that
your vcpkg instance has a complete Git history. The versioning feature of vcpkg
relies on having a complete commit history to retrieve specific port versions.

### Use vcpkg as a submodule

An easy way to acquire vcpkg in your CI environment is to declare the vcpkg
repository as a submodule of your repository.

```bash
git submodule init
./vcpkg/vcpkg-bootstrap.sh
```

### Use Git CLI

A secondary method is to run a Git command as part of your CI scripts to clone
an instance of the vcpkg repository.

```bash
git clone http://github.com/Microsoft/vcpkg
./vcpkg/vcpkg-bootstrap.sh
```

### Use a third-party action/script

Depending on the vendor you use to run your CI environment, there may be readily
available third-party scripts that can acquire vcpkg in a single step. The vcpkg
team does not maintain any of these third-party scripts and you should exercise
proper caution if you intend to use any of them.

### Other acquisition methods

The following methods are not recommended for CI environments.

* The one-line installation script: `iex (iwr -useb
  https://aka.ms/vcpkg-init.ps1)` or `. <(curl https://aka.ms/vcpkg-init.sh
  -L)`.
  This is a vcpkg distribution method that enables the "artifacts" experimental
  feature and is not recommended for most users.

## Set up binary cache

It is highly recommended that you enable a binary cache to avoid rebuilding your
project's dependencies on each CI run.

To learn more about binary caching read these articles:

* [Authenticate NuGet
  feeds](../consume/binary-caching-nuget.md#provide-authentication-credentials)
* [Binary caching configuration reference](../reference/binarycaching.md)


## Set up an asset cache

Setting up an asset cache will make your CI environment more resilient to errors
caused by external services.
