# Tutorial: Set up a vcpkg binary cache using filesystem directories

You are not limited to the [default binary cache](binary-caching-default.md) location as your only
local binary cache, it is possible to configure multiple filesystem locations as binary caches. You
can even set up specific caches with different permissions, such as read-only, write-only, or read
and write permissions.

All binary caches are configured through the `VCPKG_BINARY_SOURCES` environment variable. The value
of `VCPKG_BINARY_SOURCES` follows a  specific [configuration
syntax](../reference/binarycaching.md#configuration-syntax).

In this tutorial you'll learn how to:

> [!div class="checklist"]
> * [Create a binary cache directory](#1---create-a-binary-cache-directory)
> * [Configure `VCPKG_BINARY_SOURCES`](#2---configure-vcpkg_binary_sources)

## Prerequisites

* A terminal
* vcpkg

## 1 - Create a binary cache directory

When using the [`files`](../reference/binarycaching.md#files) backend, you can use filesystem
directories to store your binary packages, including network locations.

In this tutorial, you'll create two binary cache locations, one with read-write
access and a second one with only read access.

Create the two binary cache locations (substitute with any locations of your choosing):

::: zone pivot="shell-powershell, shell-cmd"

```console
mkdir D:\vcpkg\binary-cache
mkdir \\remote\shared\vcpkg\binary-cache
```

::: zone-end
::: zone pivot="shell-bash"

```bash
mkdir /home/vcpkg/binary-cache
mkdir /mnt/remote/shared/vcpkg/binary-cache
```

::: zone-end

## 2 - Configure `VCPKG_BINARY_SOURCES`

Next set the value of `VCPKG_BINARY_SOURCES` as follows:

::: zone pivot="shell-powershell"

```PowerShell
$env:VCPKG_BINARY_SOURCES="clear;files,\\remote\shared\vcpkg\binary-cache,read;files,D:\vcpkg\binary-cache,readwrite"
```

::: zone-end
::: zone pivot="shell-cmd"

```console
set "VCPKG_BINARY_SOURCES=clear;files,\\remote\shared\vcpkg\binary-cache,read;files,D:\vcpkg\binary-cache,readwrite"
```

::: zone-end
::: zone pivot="shell-cmd, shell-powershell"
This `VCPKG_BINARY_SOURCES` configuration adds the following source strings:

* `clear`, disables any previously configured binary cache, in this case, it disables the [default
  binary cache](binary-caching-local.md).
* `files,\\remote\shared\vcpkg\binary-cache,read`, sets a binary cache using the filesystem backend,
  `files`, located in `\\remote\shared\vcpkg\binary-cache`, and gives it read-only permissions
  (`read` is the default permission).
* `files,D:\vcpkg\binary-cache,readwrite`, sets a second filesystem binary cache, located in
  `D:\vcpkg\binary-cache`, and gives it read-write permissions (`readwrite`).
::: zone-end

::: zone pivot="shell-bash"

```bash
export VCPKG_BINARY_SOURCES="clear;files,/mnt/remote/shared/vcpkg/binary-cache,read;files,/home/vcpkg/binary-cache,readwrite"
```

This `VCPKG_BINARY_SOURCES` configuration adds the following source strings:

* `clear`, disables any previously configured binary cache, in this case, it disables the [default
  binary cache](binary-caching-local.md).
* `files,/mnt/remote/shared/vcpkg/binary-cache,read`, sets a binary cache using the filesystem backend,
  `files`, located in `/mnt/remote/shared/vcpkg/binary-cache`, and gives it read-only permissions
  (`read` is the default permission).
* `files,/home/vcpkg/binary-cache,readwrite`, sets a second filesystem binary cache, located in
  `/home/vcpkg/binary-cache`, and gives it read-write permissions (`readwrite`).

::: zone-end
