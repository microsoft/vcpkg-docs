# Provide usage documentation for your ports

## Overview

Providing usage documentation for ports allows users to easily adopt them in their
projects. We highly encourage providing a `usage` file within the port's directory (`ports/<port
name>/usage`) that describes the minimal steps necessary to integrate with a build system.

### Supplying a usage file

To provide usage documentation create a text file named `usage` in the port's `share`
installation directory. The recommended method is to call the `file(INSTALL ...)` function in
`portfile.cmake`.

For example:

```cmake
file(INSTALL "${CMAKE_CURRENT_LIST_DIR}/usage" DESTINATION "${CURRENT_PACKAGES_DIR}/share/${PORT}")
```

After installing ports, vcpkg detects files installed to `${CURRENT_PACKAGES_DIR}/share/${PORT}/usage` and prints their usage instructions.

### Content format

Provide clear instructions on how to use the package. The content should be concise, well-structured, and emphasize the minimum build system integration required to use the library.

Be clear and concise about how to utilize the package effectively. Avoid
overwhelming users with code snippets, command-line instructions, or
configuration details. Instead, use the [`"documentation"` property in the
port's `vcpkg.json` file](../concepts/manifest-mode.md) so users can learn more
about your library.

Use the following templates as a pattern for your `usage` files:

Packages with CMake targets:

```text
<port> provides CMake targets:

  <instructions>
```

Header-only libraries:

```text
<port> is header-only and can be used from CMake via:

  <instructions>
```

#### Example of `usage` file

```text
proj provides CMake targets:

  find_package(PROJ CONFIG REQUIRED)
  target_link_libraries(main PRIVATE PROJ::proj)
```
